# BRACU-CSE-422-Lab-Project-Report
---
**BRACU-CSE-422-Lab-Project-Report**, will contain the final report for our CSE 422 lab project. Using a dataset provided by our lab instructor, We will (Group 7 of Section 9) explore and analyze the "hotel_bookings" dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts "To Be Added".
---
The report will detail the entire process, including:

1.  **Introduction**: A brief overview of the project's aim, problem statement, and motivation.
2.  **Dataset Description**: A detailed breakdown of the dataset's characteristics, including features, data points, and data types, as well as a discussion of correlation.
3.  **Imbalanced Dataset**: An analysis of the class distribution in your target variable.
4.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: An exploration of important relationships within the data.
5.  **Dataset Pre-processing**: A discussion of data faults (null values, categorical data, scaling) and the solutions applied.
6.  **Dataset Splitting**: The methodology for dividing the data into training and testing sets.
7.  **Model Training & Testing**: The application of at least two supervised models and a Neural Network.
8.  **Unsupervised Learning**: An application of K-Means clustering.
9.  **Model Selection/Comparison Analysis**: A comparison of all models using various performance metrics.
10. **Conclusion**: A summary of our findings, model performance, and challenges faced.
